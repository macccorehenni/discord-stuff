# My fave Discord Servers
## Videostreamers (YT, Twitch)
1. [Tanuki Dan and the Leaf Gang](discord.gg/PbesXsSmpx): The Discord of [TanukiDan](twitch.tv/TanukiDan), only one of the *best* streamers on Twitch. Mostly plays Mario Maker 2, has a ++++ vibe, ADHD and autism.
2. [DGR](discord.gg/dgr): that is a [YT streamer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzg5UMJ62uoKHTkq5bgkp5g) Also plays mainly MM2, but also plays other Mario games

## Tech Interests
1. [Spotistats/Backtrack](discord.gg/spotistats): one of the best apps for music â€” made by a 17 year-old, no less
2. [r/ChromeOS](discord.gg/chromeos): I love Chromebooks. This is the Discord server for [r/chromeos](reddit.com/r/chromeos).
3. [Nova Launcher](discord.gg/novalauncher): The best Android launcher ever. Period. [Link to download](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&hl=en_US&gl=US)
4. [DrumDestroyer Themes](https://discord.gg/pccZGwW): Best Android icon packs. Ever. I definintly reccomend installing the [Unicorn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=unicorn.icons.theme.ddt&hl=en_US&gl=US) icon pack. It's nice, and adds a good color splash.
5. Apple Betas: if you are a geek like me, there's no stopping you from installing the iOS/iPadOS/macOS/audioOS/watchOS public betas. This server talks all about it. Unfortunely [*sic*], Discord is being a *butt* right now, so no link. Stay tuned!
## Games
1. [*Sky: Children of Light*](https://discord.gg/thatskygame): One of the ***best games ever***. Vincent Diamante did a really good of the soundtrack, and, yep. There's releases on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tgc.sky.android&hl=en_US&gl=US), [iOS (and also macOS, I guess)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sky-children-of-the-light/id1462117269), and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/sky-children-of-the-light-switch/).
2. [Rocket Leauge [*sic*]](https://discord.gg/rocketleague): The best competive game ever. Avalible in all these places: [Xbox](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rocket-league/C125W9BG2K0V), [PC via Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/252950), [PS](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2002-CUSA01163_00-ROCKETLEAGUENA01) and [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rocket-league-switch/).
